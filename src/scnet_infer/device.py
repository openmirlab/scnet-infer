Auto-detection chooses CUDA when available and CPU otherwise; explicit requests
are honored or rejected without silent fallback. `auto` deliberately never
resolves to MPS, on purpose, permanently -- see `mps_available()` below.
`device="mps"` on the Torch backend is refused categorically -- see
`resolve_device()`'s docstring for why this is a *stronger*-founded refusal

    chunked (`batch_size=4`) forward pass outright -- not a numeric nudge, a
    large, exactly-repeating wrong answer -- roughly one to two times in

    looped MPS calls on the same model and input in the same process. A
    silent wrong stem a third to two-thirds of the time is not a tradeoff
    worth offering through this backend. Apple Silicon acceleration is
    available and, on the same evidence, reliable: use `backend="mlx"`,
    which matched the CPU reference exactly on every trial in that
    investigation.
