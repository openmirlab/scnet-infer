"""The backend seam -- one narrow protocol every compute backend implements.

A backend owns everything framework-specific: model construction, checkpoint
weights, tensor layout, device placement, and the chunked overlap-add itself.
Chunking accumulates on-device for speed, so the seam deliberately sits at a
whole mixture rather than a single chunk -- a per-chunk seam would drag every
accumulator back to the host and hand the acceleration straight back (same
reasoning as the sibling `bs-roformer-infer` / `mdxnet-infer` packages' seams;
see `bs_roformer/brain/architecture.md`).

Above the seam nothing knows a dtype, a tensor layout, or which chip is busy:
`api.SCNetSession` decides checkpoint resolution, device/backend requests, and
result packaging once, the same way for every backend.

    `MLXBackend` builds and consumes this (`from_spec`, then `.step`/

    through it: `runtime.demix()` still computes the identical formula
    inline (`step = chunk_size // num_overlap`, `fade = chunk_size // 10`,
    `border = chunk_size - step`) at `runtime.py:60-63`. That is the same
    design decision encoded in two places, not one -- a known, deliberately
    deferred duplication rather than a fixed one. Migrating `demix()` onto
    this class is a recorded post-merge follow-up, not done here.
    `tests/test_chunking_plan.py` cross-checks both formulas against the
    registry's real chunk configs so the two cannot drift apart silently
