"""PyTorch backend -- the shipped path, unchanged, behind the seam.

Holds an already-constructed, already-loaded model plus its resolved device and
turns a mixture into stems by calling the same `runtime.demix()` the package has
always used; it is a wrapper, never a second implementation, so the Torch path
cannot drift from `SCNetSession`'s pre-seam behaviour.
